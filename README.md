# Morse-Code-Translator

To fix:

-   JS works in HTML but no when imported - fixed
-   error messages to only appear once - fixed
-   morse to eng spacing unit test not working - fixed was having particular trouble testing for 2 or 4+ spaces but had to use 2 separate regex to ensure when user puts in 3 spaces they are not alerted
-   place js into its own folder -fixed
-   add tooltip containing morse code alphabet
